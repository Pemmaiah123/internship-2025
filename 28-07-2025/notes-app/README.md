# A note app
## To create a simple note app using react js, mui.
A central text area where users can type their notes.
Should be large and clearly visible for easy editing.
**"New +" Button:**
Placed at the top of the left sidebar.
When clicked, it saves the current note and adds it to the list below.
### Notes List (Sidebar):
Located vertically on the left side of the screen
Displays saved notes as a list.
Each new note appears below the previous ones, pushing the “New +” button further down.
**Action Buttons:**
Located on the top right of the typing area.
A "Done" button (to mark the note as complete or close the editor).
A "Delete" button (to remove the current note).
**No Persistence Required:**
Notes will not be saved to local storage or any backend.
All data will be temporary and lost upon page refresh.
